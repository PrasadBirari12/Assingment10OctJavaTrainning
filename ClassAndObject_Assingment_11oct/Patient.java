//2) Design a class that can be used by a health care professional to keep track of a patient’s vital statistics. 
//The following are the details.
//Name of the class - Patient
//Member Variables - patientName(String),height(double),weight(double)
//Member Function - double computeBMI()
//The above method should compute the BMI and return the result. The formula for computation of BMI  
//is weight (in kg) ÷ height*height(in metres).
//Create an object of the Patient class and check the results.
